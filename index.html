        <h2><span>Quantifying Evolving Risk and Identifying Effective Policy Actions for a Resilient Future</span></h2>
        <p>Disaster risk is dynamic. It is affected by spatial and temporal changes in its underlying components:  hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Disaster risk may increase or decrease in response to natural and anthropogenic influences, and often evolves disproportionately in different locations, economic sectors, and population groups.</p>
        <div class="well">
          <p><b>Hazard</b> refers to the likelihood and intensity of a potentially destructive natural phenomenon, such as ground shaking induced by an earthquake or wind speed associated with a cyclone. Climate change and climate variability contribute to the evolution of hazard by altering the frequency, intensity, seasonality, and geographic coverage of these phenomena.</p>
          <p><b>Exposure</b> refers to the location, attributes, and value of important community assets that are exposed to the hazard, such as people, buildings, agricultural land, and infrastructure. Population growth, urbanization, and socioeconomic development drive the evolution of exposure, and have been the primary driver of disaster losses in recent decades.</p>
          <p><b>Vulnerability</b> is the potential extent to which physical, social, economic, and environmental assets may become damaged or disrupted when exposed to a hazard event. <b>Physical vulnerability</b> refers to the level of damage sustained by built structures due to the physical load imparted by a hazard event. <b>Socioeconomic</b> or <b>social vulnerability</b> refers to factors such as livelihood, social connections, and gender, which influence a community’s ability to respond to, cope with, and recover from a disaster. Vulnerability can affect the number of casualties, the loss or disruption sustained, and the community’s subsequent recovery time. Socioeconomic development, unplanned urban development, unsafe building practices, the occurrence of disasters themselves, and the efficacy of post-disaster recovery all affect vulnerability.</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote class="right">“Risk assessments need to account for temporal and spatial changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas or where climate change impacts will be felt the most. A risk assessment that provides an estimation of evolving or future risk is a way to engage stakeholders in carrying out actions now in order to avoid or mitigate the risk that is accumulating in their city or country. For example, risk analysis offers an opportunity to quantify the decrease in future risk that arises from better enforcement of building codes, and hence to demonstrate the benefit of spending additional funds on building code enforcement” (216).<a class="footnote" id="fn1">1</a></blockquote>
        <p>Urban development, investments in infrastructure, and disaster risk management (DRM) act over multi-decadal time scales and are likely to be affected by the future evolution of disaster risk. It is therefore important that decisions made about such long-term activities and processes take the dynamic nature of disaster risk into account.</p>
        <p>Disaster risk assessment quantifies the effects of disasters in terms of potential casualties, physical damage to assets, economic losses, and fiscal loss to governments. This quantification informs risk management, disaster preparedness, financial protection, and resilient reconstruction. To promote the utility of DRM programs and to assess the impacts (costs and benefits) of current decisions on future risk, <b>disaster risk assessments must be able to quantify evolving risk</b> both with and without the effects of DRM policies. Quantifying evolving risk under different DRM policies allows risk management specialists to demonstrate <b>how actions taken now and in the near future could affect the risk environment of the mid- to long-term future.</b> This report identifies and describes the drivers of evolving disaster risk and highlights <b>key policies to promote risk reduction and to prevent an increase in risk.</b></p>

        <blockquote class="right">“A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and can result in unprecedented extremes” (111).<a class="footnote" id="fn2">2</a></blockquote>
        <p><b>Climate change is a significant driver of evolving hazard and a major factor in increasing disaster risk.</b> It has been clearly linked to changes in the characteristics of disasters.<a class="footnote" id="fn2">2</a> Research into the mechanisms and risks of changing climate shows that disaster risk has already been influenced by climate change. Other influences on changes in hazard, and hence on disaster risk, include human actions such as extraction of groundwater and certain kinds of land use. </p>

        </figure>
        <p>Global temperature increase (Figure 1) is expected to influence the frequency, severity, and seasonal patterns of precipitation and monsoon events, resulting in regional changes in flood and drought hazard. The intensity and frequency of the most extreme <b>tropical cyclones</b> have increased in the North Atlantic since 1980 <a class="footnote" id="fn3">3</a>, and spatial shifts in cyclone tracks have resulted in increased landfall intensity of cyclones in East Asia. <a class="footnote" id="fn4">4</a></p>
        <p>There has been no clear upward trend in <b>extratropical cyclone</b> (ETC) activity in the North Atlantic basin, <a class="footnote" id="fn5">5</a> but there have been increases in such activity in the South Atlantic–Indian Ocean basin and decreases in the South Pacific. <a class="footnote" id="fn6">6</a> In future, the tracks of Southern Hemisphere and North Pacific extratropical cyclones are expected to shift toward the poles, <a class="footnote" id="fn7">7</a>, <a class="footnote" id="fn8">8</a> and there is likely to be an increase in associated precipitation. <a class="footnote" id="fn9">9</a></p>
        
        <h2><span>Climate influences on flooding</span></h2>
        <p>Sea-level rise is associated with ice sheet melt, thermal expansion of ocean waters, and change in liquid water storage on land. Between 1901 and 2010, the global average mean sea level rose by an estimated 0.19 m, <a class="footnote" id="fn8">8</a> and it is likely to rise by 0.26–0.55 m by 2100 relative to 1986–2005—even if climate policies are effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 onward. <a class="footnote" id="fn8">8</a></p>
        <p>Very few coastlines around the world will avoid the effects of sea-level rise, which will result in more frequent and severe <b>coastal flooding,</b> including storm surge associated with cyclones. Where land elevation is decreasing due to subsidence and shorelines are simultaneously retreating due to coastal erosion, the coastal flood hazard is increasing dramatically. Given the global increase in hazard and the location of significant populations and assets along coasts, it is crucial that DRM and climate adaptation strategies address the factors driving evolution of the coastal flood hazard.</p>
        <p>Exposure is often concentrated along rivers. In some locations repeated flooding causes severe disruption—not only to the urban environment but also to agriculture and rural livelihoods (Figure 2). Intensification of and seasonal shifts in rainfall, snow melt, and deglaciation of mountain ranges <a class="footnote" id="fn11">11</a> alter the timing, severity, and geographical distribution of extreme <b>river flood</b> events in all regions of the world. There is no clear signal of climate change in the increasing losses observed over the past several decades; <a class="footnote" id="fn12">12</a>, <a class="footnote" id="fn13">13</a> these are primarily driven by exposure change. Future changes in flood hazard—specifically flood frequency and intensity—are expected, however. <a class="footnote" id="fn2">2</a> Another important consideration in this context is the interannual climatic variability associated with El Niño and La Niña, which influence flooding in river basins covering almost half of the earth’s surface. <a class="footnote" id="fn14">14</a></p>

        </div>
        
        <h2><span>Anthropogenic influences on flood hazard</span></h2>
        <p>Flooding is significantly affected by anthropogenic activity. As deforestation increases and urban drainage systems and impermeable surfaces expand, there is an increase in the amount of surface runoff occurring during precipitation, and a decrease in the amount of time it takes for precipitation to reach river channels; the result is more-extreme flood peaks. Subsidence can increase flood hazard by reducing ground elevation. Though it may occur naturally (due to earthquakes or the settlement of sediment under its own weight), it is often the result of human actions such as the extraction of groundwater from underground aquifers for irrigation or water supply. Groundwater extraction occurs most intensively in urban areas, and its rate and spatial extent increase as urban populations grow and urban areas expand. The rate of subsidence can exceed that of sea-level rise, meaning that subsidence may be a greater influence on the increased coastal flood hazard than climate change impacts. <a class="footnote" id="fn16">16</a></p>
        <blockquote class="right">“In most of the large delta cities where subsidence is severe (Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok, Dhaka, Shanghai, and Tokyo), the main cause is extraction of groundwater. Rapidly expanding urban areas require huge amounts of water for domestic and industrial water supply. This need often leads to overexploitation of groundwater resources, especially when surface waters are seriously polluted (Jakarta, Dhaka).” <a class="footnote" id="fn16">16</a></blockquote>
        <p>In Manila Bay, Philippines, extraction has contributed to increased flood risk by lowering the land by several centimeters each year—in some years by more than 10 cm. <a class="footnote" id="fn17">17</a> In Jakarta, Indonesia, 2 m of subsidence is estimated to have occurred between 1999 and 2013, with an additional 1.8 m expected between 2013 and 2025. <a class="footnote" id="fn16">16</a> At current rates of subsidence and sea-level rise, and without coastal protection, residential and industrial areas of north Jakarta, major transport links (including the international airport), and ports could be submerged within 100 years. <a class="footnote" id="fn18">18</a></p>
        <p>Coastal erosion can cause evolution in coastal flood hazard by reducing the buffer zone that separates coastal populations and assets from coastal hazards (such as flooding, storm surge, and tsunami). Erosion is a global issue, occurring from the coasts of Yorkshire, England, <a class="footnote" id="fn19">19</a> to small island states such as Maldives. <a class="footnote" id="fn20">20</a> Naturally occurring erosion may be exacerbated by sea-level rise or by more frequent storm surge events. Sediment transport deficit can also cause or contribute to erosion; it occurs when the construction of river dams or other coastal works prevents natural sediment refill. The development of a coastal highway in Alexandria, Egypt, for example, has reduced the amount of sediment reaching coastal areas, contributing to “chronic long-term coastal erosion” of c. 20 cm per year. <a class="footnote" id="fn21">21</a> </p>
        
        <h2><span>Changing precipitation’s effect on slope instability</span></h2>
        <p>Heavy rainfall and flooding contribute to slope instability by increasing soil water pressure and undercutting slopes or cliffs. Intensification of and seasonal shifts in rainfall thus lead to evolution in <b>landslide</b> hazard. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expresses high confidence that climate change–driven changes in heavy precipitation will give rise to changes in slope instability and mass movement. <a class="footnote" id="fn2">2</a> According to an analysis of fatal landslides in Southeast Asia, the upward global trend in the number of reported landslide fatalities is strongly attributed to increased population on landslide-prone land, destabilization of slopes, and deforestation. <a class="footnote" id="fn22">22</a> Landslides are sensitive to high-intensity precipitation events related to high temperatures, <a class="footnote" id="fn23">23</a> and monsoon intensity and the number of tropical cyclones making landfall influence the number of fatal landslides. <a class="footnote" id="fn22">22</a> </p>
        
        <h2><span>An uncertain future drought hazard</span></h2>
        <p>There are distinct regional variations in the projected direction of change in <b>drought</b>, and in the magnitude of factors contributing to drought (i.e., precipitation, runoff, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration). Whereas some studies have found signals of increases in drought occurrence under climate change, <a class="footnote" id="fn24">24</a>, <a class="footnote" id="fn25">25</a> such trends are not considered significant on a global scale. <a class="footnote" id="fn26">26</a></p>
        <div class="well">Drought may be classified as:
        <ol>
          <li><i>meteorological</i> drought (i.e., a relative deficit of precipitation);</li>
          <li><i>agricultural</i> or soil moisture drought (i.e., a relative deficit of soil moisture in the root zone); </li>
          <li><i>hydrological</i> drought (i.e., a relative deficit of groundwater, streamflow, or lake levels); <a class="footnote" id="fn2">2</a> or </li>
          <li><i>water scarcity</i> or socioeconomic drought (i.e. a deficit in water availability relative to the water consumption by households, agriculture and industry) <a class="footnote" id="fn25">25</a> </li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <p>On a global scale, the estimated share of the world population facing <i>water scarcity</i>, or socioeconomic drought (that is, drought partially driven by human activities such as intensive agriculture or groundwater extraction), increased from 20 percent in 1960 to 50 percent in 2000. <a class="footnote" id="fn27">27</a> In the short term (6 to 10 years), hydroclimatic variability is responsible for almost 80 percent of the yearly change in water scarcity, whereas socioeconomic development is the driving force behind long-term changes.</p>
        <p>Projected warming by several degrees is likely to reduce precipitation in the Mediterranean, southwest United States, and southern Africa, and decrease runoff and soil moisture in southern Europe and the Middle East. In these already water-scarce regions, <a class="footnote" id="fn8">8</a> warming is likely to exacerbate water scarcity. The IPCC has high confidence that heat and drought stress will result in reduced crop productivity, increased pest and disease damage, and flood impacts on food system infrastructure, which will in turn harm livelihoods and food security.</p>
        
        <h2><span>Extreme heat and wildfire</span></h2>
        <p>Rising temperatures are expected to result in greater severity, frequency, and extent of <b>extreme heat</b> events—both “highly unusual” events (such as those in Russia and Central Asia in 2010 and the United States in 2012) and “unprecedented” events (which have not occurred under present-day climate conditions). <a class="footnote" id="fn28">28</a> Such heat events are a primary driver of climate-related human migration <a class="footnote" id="fn29">29</a> and are a cause of human health problems. Figure 3 indicates the regional scale of high temperatures through a snapshot of one month—July 2012—in which temperatures were higher than the long-term average. These July temperatures contributed to an historically severe drought in 2012: in that year, severe-to-extreme drought affected 39 percent of the United States—the largest extent since the 1950s. <a class="footnote" id="fn30">30</a></p>

        <p>The expected increase in number of hot days over a larger area of North America <a class="footnote" id="fn32">32</a> increases the spatial extent of heat-related mortality, wildfire risk, and drought-affected regions.

      </div>
      <section>
        <p><b>The rise in disaster losses over the past decades can be attributed mainly to changes in socioeconomic factors—population and asset values of structures and infrastructure.</b> The effect of exposure on increasing disaster losses is strong, and has been established with much more confidence than the effect of hazard and vulnerability. <a class="footnote" id="fn12">12</a></p>
        <blockquote class="right">“Increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters (high confidence)” (9). <a class="footnote" id="fn2">2</a></blockquote>
        <p>Increases in global exposure to natural hazards have largely been driven by population growth and rising urbanization rates. The global population exposed to river and coastal flooding, for example, doubled between 1970 and 2010, increasing from around 520 million to almost 1 billion. <a class="footnote" id="fn37">37</a> The total surface area of urban areas exposed to flooding in the same period increased by a greater proportion, from 18,000 to 44,000 km2. Both population and urbanization are expected to continue their growth trend into the future.</p>
        <p>Regional contributions to growth and rates of urbanization are variable (Figure 5). Probabilistic analyses of United Nations population data show that the population of Asia is expected to peak at over 5 billion people in 2050 before declining until 2100. The populations of Europe, North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean are expected to remain around their current size, and the population of Africa shows the largest expected increase, from 1.1 billion today to 2.5 billion in 2050 and over 4 billion in 2100. <a class="footnote" id="fn38">38</a></p>
        <div class="well">
          <p>Urbanization — the increase in proportion of the world population living in cities compared to rural areas—is a particularly important factor in evolving exposure. Cities are dense, highly concentrated locations of exposure, so when they are affected by a disaster, losses can be disproportionately large.</p>

        <p>Rapid and unplanned expansion of urban populations increases exposure either through increased density, as cities build upward, or by outward expansion, as the population increases, spreads over a wider area, and causes changes in land use. The urban poor are most likely to settle in low-value hazardous areas, for example on unstable slopes or reclaimed land (which is often susceptible to flooding and liquefaction); their exposure to hazard and their socioeconomic vulnerability to disasters are thus disproportionately high. In many urban areas that have expanded rapidly in the past decades, the absence of urban planning has led to uncontrolled developments in hazardous areas, such as landslide-prone hillside favelas in Rio de Janeiro and settlements in areas of high flood hazard in Jakarta, Manila, and Bangkok.</p>
        <p>Increased exposure in coastal cities is an important driver of risk; these cities are already among the most populous in the world <a class="footnote" id="fn38">38</a> and have a huge amount of infrastructure exposed to coastal flooding and storm surge. These cities are also among the most rapidly growing. Coupled with the effects of evolving coastal hazards, this swift increase in exposure makes these cities are some of the key areas in which to address evolving disaster risk. </p>
        <p>Increasing global exposure to hazards is visible from space. An analysis of a time series of satellite night light data between 1992 and 2012 shows the patterns of steadily increasing concentration of people and economic activity in urban and coastal areas, and along transport networks.</p>

      </div>
      <section>
        <p><b>Vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of exposed people, assets, and livelihoods to the harmful effects of natural hazards.</b> A populations’ socioeconomic or social vulnerability <a class="footnote" id="fn41">41</a> may evolve over time positively or negatively depending on a large number of influencing factors, such as education, age, wealth, and access to resources and political power. <a class="footnote" id="fn41">41</a></p>
        <p>The vulnerability of people and assets is strongly related to income and development standards. Vulnerability is therefore shown to be higher in low-income countries than high-income countries, and global vulnerability is gradually declining. <a class="footnote" id="fn15">15</a>, <a class="footnote" id="fn42">42</a> On the other hand, gradual environmental degradation or sudden shocks that impact livelihoods or people in a region or community can increase vulnerability. Vulnerability can remain high if reconstruction or adaptation is not undertaken, or if maladaptation occurs during unplanned or poorly planned development. <a class="footnote" id="fn43">43</a></p>
        <p>Physical vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure determines the potential level of damage for a given disaster impact. Physical vulnerability can increase over time if a structure or infrastructure is not maintained, or if its design and construction standards are insufficient for the increased intensity or frequency of future hazard. For example, structures built to withstand a 1-in-50 year flood at the year of construction may not provide the same level of protection under altered climatic conditions, when a 1-in-50 year flood may be characterized by higher inundation depths or flow velocities.</p>

        <div class="well">The evolution of vulnerability is closely linked with evolution of exposure. Rising economic wealth, which may increase economic exposure, is generally associated with declining vulnerability. <a class="footnote" id="fn45">45</a>, <a class="footnote" id="fn46">46</a>, <a class="footnote" id="fn47">47</a> Vulnerability to disasters may decline due to improved building standards and land-use planning, and increased catastrophe insurance penetration, which facilitates the transfer of risk.</div>
        
        <p>The agricultural sector is vulnerable to climate change. Losses may increase if the types of crops currently grown are less productive (in terms of yield) under future climate conditions, or if they are unable to withstand future conditions altogether. Thus adaptation of crop type to those less vulnerable to new conditions may be necessary to counter any increasing losses.</p>
        <p>As an urban population grows, the infrastructure that serves that population must be developed to keep pace with demand; otherwise, system capacity will be exceeded and infrastructure will become more vulnerable to shocks. Critical systems must maintain some redundancy so that they are able to cope in the case of disasters. Likewise, disaster response capacities must keep pace with the increase in potential demand.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most significant influence on the evolution of structural vulnerability is the absence of adequate building standards, formal planning, and construction practices in many rapidly developing urban areas. Typical building expansions observed in informal development drives increases in disaster risk over time, as changes to individual buildings accumulate to increase the vulnerability of the wider neighborhood. <a class="footnote" id="fn48">48</a></p>

      <section>
        <p><b>Disaster risk assessments that consider future risk can inform disaster risk management (DRM) strategy design and ensure the sustainability of DRM strategies into the future.</b> Such assessments demonstrate how the policies being implemented at the present time will influence future disaster risk, positively or negatively. By providing a baseline of expected losses with and without the implementation of policy actions, risk projections can facilitate robust decision making and enable cost-benefit analysis of risk management options.</p>
        <div class="well">Despite the many improvements in disaster risk assessment in recent years, the simulated projection of risk into the future has only recently been attempted. The common general framework on which risk models operate makes it possible to incorporate projected hazard, exposure, and vulnerability data in order to arrive at such projections.</div>
        <p>To simulate future hazard, it is possible to include projections of precipitation, temperature, humidity, etc., under future climate conditions. These parameters are generated by regional and global climate simulations that are based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Such methods have been used to investigate the potential impacts of changes in precipitation, <a class="footnote" id="fn49">49</a> drought, <a class="footnote" id="fn50">50</a> and sea-level rise <a class="footnote" id="fn51">51</a> (see Figure 8). More commonly, scenario-based adjustments are made to current patterns of frequency and intensity of hazards in order to reflect future changes. For example, a simple uplift in potential hurricane intensity was used by Hallegatte <a class="footnote" id="fn52">52</a> to assess future losses.</p>
        
        <div class="well">
          <h4>The Representative Concentration Pathways</h4>
          <p>The RCPs are four climate-outcome scenarios based on combinations of economic, technological, demographic, policy, and institutional futures. They are presented in terms of total radiative forcing (cumulative measure of human emissions of greenhouse gases [GHGs] from all sources). The higher the radiative forcing, the greater the climate warming; the warming occurs because there is more incoming solar energy and absorption of energy by GHGs than outgoing reflected energy. These pathways are applied as anthropogenic forcing conditions in global climate models to model future scenarios of climate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report is based upon these RCPs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>RCP8.5: Rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8.5 W/m2 in 2100</li>
            <li>RCP6: Stabilization without overshoot pathway to 6 W/m2 at stabilization after 2100</li>
            <li>RCP4.5: Stabilization without overshoot pathway to 4.5 W/m2 at stabilization after 2100</li>
            <li>RCP2.6: Peak in radiative forcing at ~ 3 W/m2 before 2100 and decline after 2100</li>

        <p>As an important driver of disaster losses, changing exposure must be accounted for in the quantification of future risk. Many risk assessments use a snapshot of exposure data, taken from the present or from some time in the past; an example is the use of census data to establish the population at risk. But this approach offers a static view of past exposure. Statistical projections of population—derived from spatial data on historical and expected future trends in population, land use, and economic assets—can be used to integrate evolving exposure into disaster risk assessment. Studies forecast an increase in exposure to global river flood hazard in the future, based on models describing spatial changes in socioeconomic development <a class="footnote" id="fn37">37</a>, <a class="footnote" id="fn54">54</a> or a combination of climate change and socioeconomic development <a class="footnote" id="fn55">55</a>, <a class="footnote" id="fn56">56</a>.</p>
        <p>Mapping past urban extent (Figure 9) can make it possible to visualize spatial patterns of expansion and can help validate projections of expansion (e.g., Figure 10). When future projections of population, demographics, and population distribution are considered alongside projections of socioeconomic conditions in the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, they can be developed and incorporated into disaster risk assessment.</p>

          <h3>The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways</h3>
          <p>The SSPs are five “reference pathways describing plausible alternative trends in the evolution of society and ecosystems over a century timescale, in the absence of climate change or climate policies.” <a class="footnote" id="fn58">58</a> Each SSP consists of a narrative storyline, which provides a starting point for the quantification of factors that influence population and economic growth. SSPs are incorporated into the Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) draft scenarios that provide population, urbanization, and gross domestic product projections for every decade until 2100. <a class="footnote" id="fn59">59</a></p>
          <p>SSPs are generally described as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>SSP 1: Low challenges for mitigation and adaptation—reasonably high pace of sustainable development, technological change, and environmentally friendly processes</li>
            <li>SSP 2: Moderate—an intermediate case between SSP 1 and SSP 3</li>
            <li>SSP 3: High mitigation and adaptation challenges—low adaptive capacity in many regions, moderate economic growth, and unmitigated emissions</li>
            <li>SSP 4: Low mitigation challenges, high adaptation challenges—regionally divided technological development, with some regions able to mitigate emissions, but others left with low adaptive capacity</li>
            <li>SSP5: High mitigation challenges, low adaptation challenges—absence of climate policies and low investment in alternative energy technology; rapid economic development leads to equitable distribution of resources and globally high adaptive capacity</li>

        <p>A complex and often-neglected component of evolving risk is the change in vulnerability over time. Studies commonly assume future vulnerability to be the same as present-day vulnerability, and thus tend to focus on adjustments to hazard and exposure. Incremental building construction is an important driver of changing vulnerability, influenced by socioeconomic changes. When buildings are expanded outward and upward, their structural response to earthquakes changes, meaning that vulnerability changes with each expansion. Building expansion models can be used to simulate changes in building stock over future decades and show that informal building expansion increases risk through time <a class="footnote" id="fn60">60</a>. Similarly, such expansion models can be used to demonstrate the impacts of building legislation on incremental changes in vulnerability.</p>

        <h1 title="Influencing Risk">Identifying Effective Policies for a Resilient Future</h1>
      </div>
      <section>
        <p>Decision makers have the opportunity now to positively influence the future evolution of disaster risk: decisions made and actions taken in the present or near future can arrest increases in future disaster risk. To inform development decisions, policies should take into account scientific advice on future climate conditions and the results of quantified disaster risk projections.</p>
        <div class="well">
          <p>Disaster risk evolves—and losses increase—when planning fails to take into account the existence of hazards and the impact of socioeconomic development on exposure and vulnerability. Additionally, some policy actions can inadvertently increase disaster risk by increasing exposure in hazardous areas or allowing practices that increase vulnerability.</p>
        </div>
        <p>There are multiple disaster risk management (DRM) policy tools and strategies available. Combining a variety of policies is the best way to mitigate risk and provide adaptive capacity at different spatial and temporal scales and correlations <a class="footnote" id="fn61">61</a>, and in different sectors of the economy and population. For example: physical defenses provide protection from small, frequent events at the local scale; land-use planning can reduce exposure (in balance with the need to exploit valuable land that may be hazardous, e.g., coastlines); and insurance mechanisms can target high-loss events that occur less frequently, such as those with return periods of hundreds of years.</p>
        <p>This section highlights a number of policies that can <b>have a positive impact on the evolution of disaster risk.</b></p>
        
        <h2><span>Mitigate climate change</span></h2>
        <p>The mitigation of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and temperature increase is key to limiting increases in frequency and intensity of extreme heat, wildfire, drought, wind, and flood hazards. With the effects of climate change already resulting in more frequent periods of extreme heat, and more intense rainfall <a class="footnote" id="fn28">28</a>, <a class="footnote" id="fn35">35</a>, further increases in global temperature must be avoided to prevent even greater increases in future disaster risk. Sea-level rise is projected to inundate developed coastal areas, making them uninhabitable and overwhelming existing infrastructure (Figure 11).</p>

        <p>The sectors contributing most to greenhouse gas emissions are electricity and heat production; agriculture, forestry, and other land uses; industry; and transport. Policy decisions in multiple development sectors are interconnected with climate change and should be considered as such. Activities in industry, transport, and infrastructure development all contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly where these are long-term investments that contribute to emissions for many years after initial construction.</p>
        <blockquote class="right">
          <p>“Infrastructure developments and long-lived products that lock societies into GHG-intensive emissions pathways may be difficult or very costly to change, reinforcing the importance of early action for ambitious mitigation” (18). <a class="footnote" id="fn63">63</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Policies that promote use of environmentally friendly or “green” technologies, such as renewable energy in buildings, transport, and infrastructure, should be encouraged. Where energy generation needed for economic development is concerned, using carbon dioxide capture and storage (CSS) and nuclear or bioenergy <a class="footnote" id="fn63">63</a> instead of fossil fuels can contribute to climate change mitigation.</p>
        
        <h2><span>Avoid and mitigate the effects of harmful land-use change</span></h2>
        <p>Land-use change due to urban development or deforestation of land for agricultural use can increase flood risk by increasing peak river flow volumes and the speed of runoff over land. As a greater proportion of rainfall lands directly on and flows rapidly over the ground surface, more rainfall can reach river channels faster, instead of soaking into and flowing through the ground. A major influence on this change in flow regime is the replacement of natural surfaces with impermeable surfaces.</p>
        <p><b>Retention of natural land surfaces and use of sustainable urban drainage systems (Figure 12) can mitigate the negative effects of land surface change on flooding.</b> In some areas of unplanned development, drainage systems are inadequate to carry surface water to rivers or the coast. Installing sustainable drainage systems (having the capacity to cope with projected rainfall in a future climate) can help to manage urban flood risk. Because changes in the flow regime in upper parts of river catchments can also affect downstream reaches and communities, catchment-level analyses are required to assess the impact of land-use change on flood risk for the whole catchment.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <h2><span>Decelerate rates of coastal subsidence</span></h2>
        <p><b>The implications of urban expansion must be accounted for in effective urban planning and resource management.</b> Subsidence due to groundwater extraction is a very important factor in increasing coastal flood risk; indeed, subsidence often contributes more to relative sea-level change than sea-level rise.</p>
        <p>Using alternative sources of water, such as piped supply from surface reservoirs, can reduce the proportion of urban supply that is sourced from aquifers beneath major cities. Increasing the market price for groundwater pumping versus piped supply can also help to reduce groundwater extraction <a class="footnote" id="fn65">65</a>; in Jakarta, for example, groundwater supply is taxed. Subsidence can be reduced and halted by reducing groundwater extraction, although it can take years for the groundwater level to rise sufficiently for subsidence to stop altogether, as the experience of Tokyo shows <a class="footnote" id="fn16">16</a>.</p>
        
        <h2><span>Carry out urban expansion with risk-conscious planning</span></h2>
        <p>Change in exposure is shown to be responsible for the majority of increase in disaster risk. Population growth and urban expansion in hazard-prone regions rapidly increase disaster risk, especially in low-income countries. <b>Community and urban development plans should</b> include land-use planning policies to <b>prevent new development or change in use on hazard-prone land and to reduce exposure to hazards</b> where possible.</p>
        <div class="well">
          <p>Land-use planning legislation can be part of the effort to prevent new development in hazardous areas, to relocate assets to less hazardous locations (“managed retreat”), or to restrict the types of land use permitted in hazard zones—that is, to allow nonintensive uses, such as open community spaces, and prohibit residential use.</p>
        </div>
        <p>When land-use planning decisions relate to hazards that can evolve in future climates, they must take those future conditions into consideration. (Such decisions are exemplified by land-use restrictions within riverine or coastal flood hazard zones.) It is also important to ensure that structures and communities established in areas considered nonhazardous today are not found to be at risk in several decades. Thus development currently being planned or approved must account for the potential for more frequent and extensive inundation from rising sea levels or more extreme precipitation in the future.</p>
        
        <h2><span>Carry out resilient post-event reconstruction</span></h2>
        <p>There is often a <b>post-disaster window of opportunity</b> during which decision makers can <b>increase resilience to future events</b> through land-use planning or resilient reconstruction. By relocating assets or critical infrastructure out of hazard zones, a reconstructed community may reduce its exposure to future hazards. In the reconstruction plans for Tohoku, Japan, following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, residential buildings, schools, and hospitals were relocated out of the tsunami hazard zone. Under the reconstruction plan, the highest-hazard areas were reserved for low-density activities (such as light industry), activities that needed to be located on a coast, or activities requiring open space; this approach sought to minimize economic loss and loss of life in future events. Similarly, reconstruction in Christchurch, New Zealand, following the 2011 earthquake has reserved large areas of the city for use as green space due to the high liquefaction hazard. As a rule, post-disaster reconstruction should take into account technical, economic, sociocultural, and regulatory aspects of planning and building design to reduce future risk, in addition to sustainable design and construction of water, sanitation, and transport infrastructure. <a class="footnote" id="fn66">66</a></p>
        
        <h2><span>Ensure sustainable and safe habitation </span></h2>
        <p>New construction and urban development should be designed to be sustainable and to ensure safe habitation; they should be able to cope with projected climate conditions of increased heat extremes and changing patterns of intense precipitation. Construction policy should take into account the fact that building construction and use contribute to climate change through CO2 emissions in construction and energy use throughout the building’s lifetime.</p>
        <blockquote class="right">
          <p style="font-style: normal">There are significant lock-in risks associated with the long lifespans of buildings and related infrastructure <a class="footnote" id="fn67">67</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The habitability of structures is an important issue both in regions facing high temperatures under the current climate and in regions expected to experience increased temperatures over the coming decades. Heat stress can be mitigated by climate-aware urban planning (which comprises strategically placed “green” and “blue” spaces), and—once a heat wave hits—it can be responded to by providing affected populations with information and cooling facilities. Individual buildings can be made safer for inhabitants during heat waves through sustainable temperature control, which relies not on air conditioning but on natural cooling and ventilation systems and shading (for example, by fitting shutters).</p>
        
        <h2><span>Implement and adhere to building codes</span></h2>
        <p>Implementing mandatory building codes and affiliated construction standards is an important step in increasing disaster preparedness. Building codes have been implemented for floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes in a number of countries, and have been shown to successfully reduce disaster losses. <a class="footnote" id="fn68">68</a> However, the continuous adaptation of building restrictions to increasing flood hazard under climate change and human activities in the flood plain is crucial and is often not fully accounted for. <a class="footnote" id="fn69">69</a></p>
        <p>Controlling building practices through legislation or nonstatutory means can determine the evolution of vulnerability into the future. For example, the introduction of building legislation following an earthquake in New Zealand in 1931 likely meant that there were far fewer unreinforced masonry homes in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2010–2011, when the city was affected by a series of damaging earthquakes. The number of lives saved in just one event because of legislation decades earlier may be difficult to quantify, but this case demonstrates the logical and long-term benefits of building codes. Generally, buildings are designed according to a series of performance objectives, which seek to provide life safety, though critical facilities should be designed to remain operational in an emergency.</p>
        <div class="well">
          <h3>Seismic Performance Objectives</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Operational:</b> Facility is considered operational with negligible damage</li>
            <li><b>Immediate occupancy:</b> Facility can be occupied immediately, despite minor damage and minor disruption</li>
            <li><b>Life safety:</b> Life safety is substantially protected, despite some damage</li>
            <li><b>Near collapse:</b> Life safety is at risk, damage is severe, but structural collapse is prevented</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2><span>Strengthen inclusive community resilience</span></h2>
        <p>Community resilience determines the degree to which affected groups of people are able to bounce back or, preferably, bounce forward after a disaster hits <a class="footnote" id="fn70">70</a>. Strengthening resilience is therefore crucial for ensuring that recovery from disasters can take place more quickly and incorporate effective adaptation, with the aim of reducing vulnerability to ongoing hazards and the next disaster. Understanding a community’s resilience, along with changes in this resilience, is key to being able to strengthen it. Resilience is a product of a range of factors, including social, infrastructural, community capital, economic, institutional, and environmental dimensions. <a class="footnote" id="fn71">71</a></p>
        <p>Measures targeted at increasing community resilience therefore need to be designed to address one or several of these dimensions. Insurance programs and social safety nets can be effective in reducing the financial capacities of affected communities directly after the shock; strong institutions and low inequality can enable effective collaborative reconstruction; strong medical facilities may reduce the spread of water-borne diseases after a flood; and sturdier housing types may reduce the required rebuilding efforts after an earthquake.</p>
        
        <h2><span>Use ecosystem-based solutions</span></h2>
        <p>Ecosystem-based solutions can be used on the regional scale to mitigate climate changes (e.g., maintenance of forested land); on the local scale they can address a variety of hazards. Commonly, engineered flood protection structures such as levees, dams, and flood detention areas are installed along rivers and coastlines to provide defense against flooding. Engineered solutions are also an option for tackling drought (e.g., irrigation, wells, drought-resilient crops) and heat waves (e.g., air conditioning, urban planning). Although these engineered solutions can provide a high level of protection, their negative impact on natural processes is large and often leads to a disturbance of ecosystem functioning, which in turn reduces the well-being of local communities. <a class="footnote" id="fn72">72</a> Alternatives to engineered approaches include nature-based approaches or hybrid approaches that combine engineered and nature-based solutions.</p>
        <blockquote class="left">
          <p>“Ecosystem-based options are the most affordable and have positive additional consequences, but are often not as effective as other options at reducing the impact of the hazard. The evidence-base to support these options tends to be weaker so there is uncertainty regarding their effectiveness (62).” <a class="footnote" id="fn73">73</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Nature-based approaches to managing the risk of urban, riverine, and coastal flooding include maintenance of floodplains and increase in vegetation. Sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) represent a hybrid approach. The recent emphasis on nature-based flood protection is especially relevant in a world where the flood hazard is increasing under rising sea levels and higher peak river discharges. Natural shorelines evolve in response to such changing conditions and require less maintenance than traditional protection structures. <a class="footnote" id="fn74">74</a></p>
        
        <h2><span>Promote sustainable investment</span></h2>
        <p>Sustainable investment can be encouraged by considering future risk in rollout of risk reduction programs. <b>Policy instruments exist for influencing the evolution of disaster risk, but they must be enacted in development and risk management programs being implemented now.</b> These programs have long lives, and if they are not tailored to future climates, they will not be sustainable. <b>There must be collaboration across the development sector and the disaster risk assessment community</b> in order to consider the impacts of exposure and vulnerability (rather than the impacts of climate change alone) on evolving risk, and in order to prevent the maladaptation that arises when development and reconstruction programs construct facilities in areas of high hazard. This collaboration must overcome institutional, practical, and perceived barriers. <a class="footnote" id="fn75">75</a></p>
        <p>In planning any DRM strategy, consideration of future disaster risk is vital for ensuring that the investment is viable into the future, and that the development is sustainable and does not exacerbate disaster risk. Disaster risk assessments and DRM strategies should also account for the interrelation of hazards so that the effort to mitigate one hazard does not inadvertently exacerbate others. <a class="footnote" id="fn75">75</a></p>
